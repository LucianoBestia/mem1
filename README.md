Everything is changing fast. This situation is on 2019-04-06. Luciano Bestia  
The next iteration of this project is here:  https://github.com/LucianoBestia/mem2

# mem1
Learning to use Rust Wasm/WebAssembly with Dodrio Virtual Dom on a simple memory game for kids.  
The images are funny cartoon characters from the alphabet.  
The cards grid is only 4x4.  
You can play it here on the GitHubPage:  
https://lucianobestia.github.io/mem1_website/index.html  
The source files for the GitHub page are here (it needs only a simple static file server):

## Prepare the development environment  
In my previous projects are the instructions how to install a basic Rust environment.  
For Wasm we need to install wasm-pack workflow tool from here:  
https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/  
  
## Source
Absolutely everything manually coded is in Rust language in the file `/src/lib.rs`.  
No manual JavaScript or HTML needed.  
The index.html file is a standard scaffold.  
The pkg/mem.js file is generated by wasm-bindgen.  
I prepared a small simple mem1.css with flex objects for styling.   
No need for npm or web-pack.
## Build
Run in mem1/ folder
```
wasm-pack build --target no-modules
```
## Serve
Run the html server in mem1/ folder in a second terminal.
So it can continuously run while you incrementally build your changes in the first terminal.
```
basic-http-server
```
If you don't have it yet on your machine, install it with:
```
cargo install basic-http-server
```
Open the default URI in your browser
http://localhost:4000/  
## Cross-platform  
The web application can easily be converted into a cross-platform quasi native application with Electron on Desktops and PhoneGap on Mobile.  
The electron desktop application (Windows, MacOS, Linux) is here:

The PhoneGap app (Android, iOS, WindowsPhone) is here:

# Memory game rules
The game starts with a grid of 8 randomly shuffled card pairs face down - 16 cards in all.  
The first player flips over two cards with two clicks.  
If the cards do not match, the next player starts his turn with a click to turn both cards back face down. Then two clicks to flip over two cards.  
If the cards match, they are left face up and the player receives a point and continues with the next turn. No additional third click needed in that case.  
This is a programming example for Rust WebAssembly Virtual Dom application. 
For the sake of simplicity, it is made as for single player mode.
